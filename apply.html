                If you have a long history of effectively managing credit and making payments on time, you're likely to
                have
                a good credit score and will be more likely to be awarded the credit card or loan with favorable terms
                and
                rates. If you've never used credit or have negative information on your credit report, like missed
                payments,
                you may be less likely to secure a loan or credit card. If you do get the loan or credit card, you may
                get
                less favorable rates.
